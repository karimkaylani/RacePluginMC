# Welcome to Race!

> Suit up and get ready for an intense battle and race to get to the beacon first!
---
### This game mode contains multiple phases:

- ## Phase 1: Preparatory Stage (defaults to 3 minutes):

    #### You and everyone else on the server get teleported to random land somewhere in your seed. From there, get materials, food and whatever you need to win the battle! Make sure to keep an eye out for loot chests in the area as well. (PVP is disabled during this phase)

 -  ## Phase 2: Race

    #### All players get teleported to the same location, but now there is a beacon somewhere in the area. The race is on! Players can either hunt it down using the coordinates in the chat or by searching for the beam of light in the sky. Any damage taken by players will enact 3 seconds of slowness. Fight and parkour your way to the beacon first! Whatever item the winner clicks on the beacon with will be granted with a random enchantment! The round will end once everyone in the server has clicked on the beacon.
